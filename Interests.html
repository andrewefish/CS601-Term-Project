                    In my free time I enjoy pursuing personal projects
                    typically involving data analysis for financial assets.
                    I am also studying for the CPA which I plan to take in 
                    August 2022. On the weekends I enjoy walking my dog around the 
                    city, playing guitar and piano, and playing/watching basketball. 
                    At the time I began this course the Boston Celtics are playing 
                    in The Eastern Conference Finals and the dramatic finish of their 
                    first playoff game against the Brooklyn Nets is included here.
