                    I have worked as an intern for Fidelity Investments in their Asset Managament Risk 
                    department. Here I assisted with risk assesments on legal entity mergers and trade 
                    allocation procedures. I also researched their business procedures within Asset 
                    Management for automation opportunities. I developed a prototype in Java that automated
                    the data entry of financial reports into analyst models for their counter party risk 
                    department.

                    At Ernst & Young I interned with their Technology Risk Consulting practice focusing on 
                    the financial services sector. I worked on projects involving cloud risk and assisted 
                    my team with identifying client defeciences in their cloud risk analysis. I also
                    contributed to a consolidated industry standard for cloud risk and controls to be used
                    on additional projects. Following my internship I recieved a full time job offer which
                    I accepted and will begin in Fall of 2022.
