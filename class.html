                    This course (CS601 Web Application Development) serves to provide introductions 
                    to website/web-application development. This includes website languages such as 
                    (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)as well as website design and architecture. This was taken 
                    as a 6 week Summercourse offered by Boston Univeristy's Metropolitain College 
                    during the Summer of 2022.

                    As part of the CS601 curriculum I had to create a website hosted on github
                    to demonstrate my knowledge of materials learned in the course. The websites
                    default topic was to be a personal portfolio. The website is also hosted on github
                    for public viewing.
